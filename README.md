Just another repository
Hullo!
My name is Diana, i like programming with python and java and maybe ruby after I try it

Had to have high, high hopes for a livin'
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
